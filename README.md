<b>Tech Used</b>: Express, JavaScript, Node.js and MongoDB</b>
<b>Lessons Learned</b>: This project was tough to start because I was using a new model to build off of. The new model is MVC (Model View Controller). It was a little confusing to follow at first, but after getting familiar with the code, I realized it does make the code look more organized.
